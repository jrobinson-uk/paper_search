These tradeoffs suggest selection ofa moderate expected <em>chunk</em> size which should work well fora given storage system. However, ... chunksizes are better, interspersed with regions of change prefer-ring smaller <em>chunk</em> sizes.In this work, we describe a new algorithm called anchor-driven ... The new algorithm dedupli-cates on two levels – with large <em>chunks</em> and their subchunks.Deduplication with large <em>chunks</em> is done using global indexof large <em>chunk</em> hashes. The dedup with subchunks is doneby using a limited ... with subchunks is doneby using a limited deduplication context of subchunk-to-container-<em>chunk</em> mappings.

High-performance 3D graphics accelerators traditionally require multiple chips on multiple boards, including geometry, rasterizing, pixel processing, and texture mapping chips. These designs are often scalable: they can increase performance by using more chips.
