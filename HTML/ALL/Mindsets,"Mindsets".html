Social sensing aims to collect sensory data by using human population as sensor carriers (e.g., location), sensor operators (e.g., taking photos), and sensors themselves (e.g., Twitter). The Internet of Things (IoT) applications facilitate social sensing tasks. However, designing and developing IoT applications is much more complicated than designing and developing ...
