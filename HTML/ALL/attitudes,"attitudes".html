To avoid boundary problems, the first and the tenth <em>attitude</em> in the vector are considered adjacent. As seen in Fig. ... considered adjacent. As seen in Fig. 1, we regard adjacent <em>attitudes</em> as internally consistent or cognitively balanced if the adjacent <em>attitudes</em> take the same values (000 or 111).
