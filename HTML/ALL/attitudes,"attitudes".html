However, individual differences in <em>attitudes</em> ... have not been fully studied. As methods of measuring individual <em>attitudes</em> toward robots, the Negative <em>Attitudes</em> toward Robots Scale and Robot Anxiety Scale [10][11] have been ... and Robot Anxiety Scale [10][11] have been proposed.

Although negative <em>attitudes</em> are considered a good predictor of the success of human-robot ... a good predictor of the success of human-robot interaction, people’s <em>attitudes</em> may have more complex constructs. Studies on people’s <em>attitudes</em> toward computers reveal multiple dimensions of computer <em>attitudes</em>. . For example, Loyd and Gressard [8] reported three dimensions: ... dehumanization, interest, and utility. Hence, for better understanding of individual <em>attitudes</em> toward robots, multi-dimensional constructs of <em>attitudes</em> should be studied. The purpose of this study was to ... of this study was to investigate dimensions that construct people’s <em>attitudes</em> toward robots. To include broad dimensions of <em>attitudes</em>, , potential elements were extracted from people’s free descriptions and ... factor analysis were conducted based on these elements to extract <em>attitude</em> dimensions. 2.
