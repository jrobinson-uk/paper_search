The module is based on the Kolb’s <em>Learning</em> <em>Styles</em> Inventory, Felder Silverman <em>Learning</em> <em>Styles</em> Model, Gardner’s Multiple Intelligence Inventory, Reid model. Also some results of pilot study with the module are performed. Key words: e learning, <em>learning</em> <em>style</em>, , Moodle. INTRODUCTION The <em>learning</em> <em>style</em> reflects the way of information taking in and processing. “Knowing of natural <em>learning</em> <em>style</em> of every student allows taking into account the individual strengths and in this way compensating the individual weakness.” [13] In [2] Felder comments that “If professors teach exclusively in a manner that favors their students’ less preferred <em>learning</em> <em>style</em> modes, the students’ discomfort level may be great enough to interfere with their learning. On the ... teach exclusively in their students’ preferred modes, the students’ may not develop the mental dexterity to reach their potential for achievement in school and as professionals.” When the teacher knows the <em>learning</em> <em>styles</em> of the students he/she could choice relevant teaching methods to ... teaching methods to ensure most effective learning. If learner knows his/her <em>learning</em> <em>style</em> properties he/she could choice and use appropriated learning materials. From e learning point ... though listening as reading then the offering of textual materials in e learning course will be less useful for this learner. In this case according to [2] will be suitable to be included learning materials supported with audio or video information. If e learning environment supports possibilities to determine of <em>learning</em> <em>styles</em> of each learner and performs in different media formats the same e learning content then learning content and learning activities could be effectively adapted to the psychological characteristics of different learners. There are exists more than 70 <em>learning</em> <em>styles</em> theories and models [3]. Most popular of them are Myers Briggs Type Indicator, Kolb’s <em>Learning</em> <em>Styles</em> Inventory, Felder Silverman <em>Learning</em> <em>Styles</em> Model, Gardner’s Multiple Intelligence Inventory, Reid etc. Unfortunately the most popular open source e learning environments such as Moodle, Claroline etc. does not offer features for studying of <em>learning</em> <em>styles</em>. . In the frame of project “Technological and didactical issues of e learning” funded by Bulgarian National Scientific Fund under contract VU MI 111/2005 we developed  module for ... Fund under contract VU MI 111/2005 we developed module for studying of <em>learning</em> <em>styles</em>. . This module is implemented in Moodle. In the paper ... the paper we present the features of this module and some results from pilot study with the module based on the Felder Silverman <em>learning</em> <em>styles</em> model and Felder Soloman index of <em>learning</em> <em>styles</em>. .

In general they are stand alone and are not connected ... in data. [8, 9, 11]. In this case after form submitting, system determines <em>learning</em> <em>style</em> and performs some suggestions about appropriated learning materials and learning strategy. This approach is widespread.- ... filled in questionnaire data. These systems have possibilities to determine individual <em>learning</em> <em>style</em> and to compare it with previously tested persons grouped by gender, ages, regions, professional categories etc. [10] After studying of ... <br /> determining of <em>learning</em> <em>style</em> we identified following problems: There not exists integration with open source e learning environments. The tools for statistical processing and graphical presentation of results of filled in questionnaires are very poor or missing. Each of considered systems supports only one of the popular questionnaires for determining of <em>learning</em> <em>style</em>. . There are missing systems with Bulgarian interface and questionnaires translated into Bulgarian. In general studied systems support only English language. The absent of ready to use or adaptable tools for studying of <em>learning</em> <em>style</em> without identified weakness follows us to develop a module integrated in e learning environment Moodle [7]. Why in Moodle? First, Moodle ... than three years and at the moment of starting of development (April of 2007) we had about 1000 active learners. Basic characteristics of the module are: Conducting questionnaires based on the following <em>learning</em> <em>styles</em> models: o Kolb [6] o Gardner [4, 5] o Felder Soloman [2, 12] o Reid [12] Studying of learners’ preferred ... Studying of learners’ preferred e learning technologies based on own questionnaire. Graphical and verbal visualisation of determined <em>learning</em> <em>style</em>. . Personal statistics for the learner. Course statistics. Data export in MS Excel format. Figure 1. Use case diagram of the module The roles in the module are ... stored in the database. Export stored data in MS Excel. The Student can: Fill in active questionnaires. See determined for his/her <em>learning</em> <em>style</em> and graphical interpretation of the data filled in questionnaires. Figure 2. Relational database schema of the module PILOT STUDY In January 2008 we carried out the pilot study with developed module. The study was based on the Felder Silverman model of <em>learning</em> <em>styles</em>. . This model consists of four scales: Active Reflective? Sensing – Intuitive? Visual Verbal? Sequential – Global? According to [1]: Active learners learn ... to develop and upgrade e learning materials according to students’ major and individual <em>learning</em> <em>style</em>. . The data show that more than 50% of the students in studied 3 groups have mild preferences to first or second dimension in each of the scales.

Such studies give additional possibilities for design and development of more effectively e learning courses.

Typical learning management systems consider only little or, in most cases, no adaptivity. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive mechanism which enables such systems to provide students with courses that fit their individual learning styles.
