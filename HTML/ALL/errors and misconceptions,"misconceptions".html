When teaching novices programming, misconceptions can occur. Misconception are incorrect beliefs about certain programming concept. For example, some novices think that a variable can hold multiple values, in the case of two consecutive assignment statements, such as x = 5; x = 7. While explaining variables introductory materials often use ...

BACKGROUND Student <em>misconceptions</em> of programming and closely related topics have been studied for ... programming statements [16], were followed by Bayman and Mayer examining <em>misconceptions</em> related to individual program statements in Permission to make digital ... <br /> ... They found that many students had incorrect understandings or outright <em>misconceptions</em> of “much” of even very simple statements. Bonar and Soloway ... the programming knowledge of formal instruction. These studies touched upon <em>misconceptions</em>, , but their primary focus was on larger mental models ... theories of cognitive representation, or in some cases discoveries of <em>misconceptions</em> were not fully followed up pedagogically. Spohrer and Soloway [20] ... programming errors or bugs to see if they result from “<em>misconceptions</em> about the semantics of programming language constructs”. They concluded that ... Pea [18] looked beyond language constructs altogether, seeking insight into <em>misconceptions</em>. . He found a “superbug”—students’ tendency to expect computers to ... thing. Confrey [5] examined both theoretical and empirical literature on <em>misconceptions</em> in mathematics, science, and programming and noted that the primary ... that the primary focus of the research was to avoid <em>misconception</em> ... development though changes in teaching.

A variety of other work on <em>misconceptions</em> exists, but from the perspective of providing data needed to ... Thomas [19]). Thus there remains a need to investigate student <em>misconceptions</em> across a wide variety of CS1 topics. Conducting in-depth interviews ... project.

RESULTS Four themes emerged from the students’ <em>misconceptions</em> (see Table 1). Themes 1 and 4 are highly language ... and cover general misunderstandings. Theme 2 involves a number of <em>misconceptions</em> all related to an inability to properly understand the process ... functioning. Though not truly language independent, this theme and its <em>misconceptions</em> are applicable across several commonly used contemporary and historic languages. ... of Object-Oriented Programming. For the purpose of building a CI, <em>misconceptions</em> are the key data, as they are used to create ... In this paper, we focus on three of the six <em>misconceptions</em> within Theme 1: “Semantics to semantics,” (MMR1), “Primitive no default,” ... (see Table 2). Both of the Delphi process concepts these <em>misconceptions</em> fall under (MMR, PVR) were highly ranked overall for importance ... ranked highest by the Delphi experts for difficulty. The first <em>misconception</em>, , “Semantics to semantics,” (MMR1) occurred when the student inappropriately ... samples, although such information was neither given nor implied.
