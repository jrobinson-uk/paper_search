Previous studies have shown the importance of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> perceptions on performance outcome (for a meta-analytic review on domain-specific ... a predictor of later academic achievement see [34]; for programming-specific <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> see [35]). In this paper, we further explore our findings; ... seeking to define pedagogical interventions grounded in the literature of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> theories. Previous studies on programming <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> have demonstrated (by using quantitative measures) students’ <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> <br /> ... force for learning outcomes [21, 35]. Hence, we know that <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> perceptions play a focal role in Permission to make digital ... courses. However, we do not know exactly how students form <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> perceptions in the context of first programming courses. Our Grounded ... Our Grounded Theory research differs from other research on programming-related <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> perceptions in that it takes “a magnifying glass” and offers ... described look at episodes during which students construct their programming <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> perceptions in CS1 courses. In this paper we concentrate on ... concentrate on interpreting our results through the lens of Bandura’s <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> theory (combined with a hint of goal orientation theory). We ... also believe that, by discussing our results in light of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> theory, we are able to reinforce the importance of viable ... cognitive theory. The key finding is that students can develop <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> beliefs that lie in contrast to their immediately preceding programming ... COGNITIVE THEORY The core construct of social cognitive theory is <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em>. . Bandura [3, 2] summarizes several focal factors of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> that are relevant for understanding our results. In this paper ... paper we limit our discussion mainly to the sources of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> and its influence on students’ study-related behavior. Bandura’s theory discusses ... into the context of learning when possible. 2.1 Roots of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> perceptions Judgments of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> are mainly based on four sources [2]: • Enactive attainments: ... in coping efficacy. On the other hand, repeated failures lower <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em>. . This is especially true if repeated failures occur early ... experiences are not always positive.

Thus, one experience of ... across situations and activities. Thus, one experience of a high <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> ... perception in one domain does not necessarily lead to high <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> ... perceptions in later situations or other domains [2]. 2.2 Changing <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> beliefs Since <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> perceptions have such a profound influence on students, the question ... the question arises how instructors might help students enhance their <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> perceptions. Previous work on sources of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> perceptions suggests that successful experiences would be the most powerful ... is not straightforward when it comes to students with low <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> perceptions. According to [2], low <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> perceptions are not usually changed by a single successful performance ... not usually changed by a single successful performance (Bandura says <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> ... perceptions are held in “provisional status”).

[17] further theorise that the effect of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> is not on behavioural engagement (effort and persistence) alone but ... of helpful strategies) and motivational engagement (e.g. in interest, enjoyment). <em>Self</em>-  -<em>efficacy</em> also has an influence on curiosity to learn as was ... global matching task than the reflective. 2.2 Opportunities in Monitoring <em>Self</em>- -<em>Efficacy</em>, , Curiosity, and Reflectivity in Learning It has been shown ... Learning It has been shown in the previous section that <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> <br /> ... performance outcome of learning [16][17][18]. Findings in [16] suggest that <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em>- -based intervention may indeed be a means of promoting engagement ... Children in the former condition reported significantly higher increase in <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> levels from before the lesson than those in the latter ... latter condition. This finding suggests that targeted interventions can promote <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em>. . A further finding was that the increase in <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> levels was significantly related to increase in persistence and also ... problems. This points to opportunities to facilitate learning through addressing <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em>. . In fact, [17] conclude that because <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> is easier to directly promote than behavioural, cognitive, and motivational ... convenient means to promote learning outcomes. The effect of addressing <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> is cumulative as improvement in performance further enhances <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em>. . However, there may be times when it is necessary ... there may be times when it is necessary to moderate <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> levels rather than promote it. This is because a pupil ... because a pupil with wrong estimations of high level of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> for a concept that they have not previously encountered or ...

When knowledge <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> is high, curiosity may not increase with further increase in ... remains a knowledge gap [19]. Findings in [18] suggest that <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> may even play a mediation role in low levels of ... role in low levels of knowledge with higher levels of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> significantly leading to higher curiosity levels. This role of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> on state curiosity in this knowledge strata was found to ... curiosity [18]. [20] found that the relationship between curiosity and <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> may actually be an inverted u-shape suggesting that low curiosity ... may be due to either very low or very high <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em>. . This points to further need to understand the <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> of a learner in order to be able to provide ... <br /> [23]. <em>Self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> level could be used to determine if such intervention is ... is required. 2.3 The Body as a Modality of Learning <em>Self</em>- -<em>Efficacy</em>, , Curiosity, and Reflectivity In the previous section, we highlighted ... and Reflectivity In the previous section, we highlighted opportunities for <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em>, , curiosity, and reflectivity to be addressed in a learning ... evidence of the feasibility of automatic detection of levels of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> and curiosity. For example, [4] used physiological signals and interaction ... progression towards the goal) for automatic detection of levels of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em>. .
