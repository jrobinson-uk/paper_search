During the <em>practice</em> process, teachers can follow and evaluate students' hand-on abilities and ... students. Under the background of the increasing focus on engineering <em>practical</em> ability in China, an Internet-based <em>practical</em> training system is constructed and used in the <em>practical</em> education of EnE. 2. THE INTRINSIC <em>PRACTICAL</em> ... EDUCATION MODE OF ENE AND ITS DISADVANTAGES 2.1 The Traditional <em>Practical</em> Training System of EnE The <em>practical</em> training system of EnE is comprised of experiment, <em>practice</em> internship, course exercise and graduation project.

During the process, students can strengthen their <em>practical</em> ... knowledge and lay a deep foundation for future career. 3.3 <em>Practice</em> Internship Traditional <em>practice</em> mode is facing enormous challenge: the site-visiting part makes <em>practice</em> too formalized; too many students visit the same place which ... the same place which makes it difficult for teachers to <em>communicate</em> with most of the students. Most students just go to ... anything after the visit, resulting in students' submission of similar <em>practice</em> reports. Gradually, students do not take the <em>practice</em> seriously, leading to a decreasing attendance rate. However, teachers cannot ... However, teachers cannot control this phenomenon. The final grade of <em>practice</em> is mainly based on the final <em>practice</em> report, so it cannot truly reflect students' <em>practical</em> ability. In the <em>practical</em> ... training network center, teachers first upload the guide of every <em>practice</em> base, in which videos and texts can enhance students' initial ... videos and texts can enhance students' initial understanding of the <em>practice</em>. .
