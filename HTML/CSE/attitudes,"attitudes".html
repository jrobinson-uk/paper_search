These stereotypes can create negative <em>attitudes</em> toward programming, discouraging individuals from learning and accepting programming as ... accepting programming as a skill necessary for their professional development. <em>Attitudes</em> are important because they, in combination with perceptions of expected ... activities [14] such as learning computer programming. For example, positive <em>attitudes</em> toward computers have been shown to increase computer use and ... [11,26,32]. In an effort to reduce negative stereotyping and improve <em>attitudes</em> toward programming, educators and researchers have targeted elementary, middle school, ... programming as something within reach, little research has investigated adult <em>attitudes</em> towards programming [29]. In his mainstream 2012 magazine article, Wisniewski ... <br /> population density, and level of education will influence their <em>attitudes</em> towards computer programming. 3.1 Participants We targeted self-reported non-programmers, defined ... to understand views toward computing [19], they often ask about <em>attitudes</em> abstractly, or without exposing participants to actual programming.

Although it ... it would have been valid to ask participants about their <em>attitudes</em> toward programming before they played the game, it was critical ... ordinal and not normally distributed.
