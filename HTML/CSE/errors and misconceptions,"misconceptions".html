Concept Inventories (CIs) are short, multiple-choice exams that evaluate a student's understanding of core concepts of a particular course. CIs are especially useful for evaluating the effects of pedagogical techniques and interventions on student learning, as their focus on core concepts means any student should be able to answer the ...

The object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm is quite prominent in German secondary schools. To challenge and overcome possible difficulties in the learning process it is vital for educators to have knowledge about possible (mis-)conceptions. Traditionally, these are gathered by investigating the mental models of students, e.g. towards object-orientation. While on the ...

Functional programming is often presented as an advantageous programming paradigm by its advocates, but many students and teachers consider it to be hard to learn. One particular hurdle in learning functional programming is mastering the modern type systems employed in these languages. In this article, we identify student difficulties with ...

This paper reports a phenomenographic study of how introductory students view objects that have been created and stored by an object-oriented program. By analyzing student interviews, we identify five categories of description, each representing a different kind of understanding of the phenomenon. Of these categories, some represent viable understandings that ...
