The object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm is quite prominent in German secondary schools. To challenge and overcome possible difficulties in the learning process it is vital for educators to have knowledge about possible (mis-)conceptions. Traditionally, these are gathered by investigating the mental models of students, e.g. towards object-orientation. While on the ...
