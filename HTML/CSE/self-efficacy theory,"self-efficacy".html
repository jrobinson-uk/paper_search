Persistence of first-year students in computer science is a problem. Although there are many factors that determine whether a student can be successful in computer science, research has shown that some attrition is due to personal perception of their ability in computer science.

We ... also believe that, by discussing our results in light of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> theory, we are able to reinforce the importance of viable ... cognitive theory. The key finding is that students can develop <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> beliefs that lie in contrast to their immediately preceding programming ... COGNITIVE THEORY The core construct of social cognitive theory is <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em>. . Bandura [3, 2] summarizes several focal factors of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> that are relevant for understanding our results. In this paper ... paper we limit our discussion mainly to the sources of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> and its influence on students’ study-related behavior.

NP-completeness is one of the most central concepts in computer science, and has been extensively applied in many diverse application areas. Despite this, students have problems grasping the concept and, more specifically, applying it to new problems. Independently, we have identified these problems at our universities in different countries and ...
