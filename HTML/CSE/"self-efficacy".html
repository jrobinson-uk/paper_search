Persistence of first-year students in computer science is a problem. Although there are many factors that determine whether a student can be successful in computer science, research has shown that some attrition is due to personal perception of their ability in computer science.

The key finding is that students can develop <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> beliefs that lie in contrast to their immediately preceding programming ... COGNITIVE THEORY The core construct of social cognitive theory is <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em>. . Bandura [3, 2] summarizes several focal factors of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> that are relevant for understanding our results. In this paper ... paper we limit our discussion mainly to the sources of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> and its influence on students’ study-related behavior.

Previous work on sources of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> perceptions suggests that successful experiences would be the most powerful ... is not straightforward when it comes to students with low <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> perceptions.

Finally, <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> judgments also influence how students perceive their accomplishments. Bandura [2] ... how students perceive their accomplishments. Bandura [2] also emphasizes that <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> perceptions alone do not predict behaviors well. Instead, <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> perceptions combined with outcome beliefs (e.g., what people assume will ... as we discuss below. First, there are people with high <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> judgments who may judge a specific outcome as either positive ... If their outcome judgment is negative then people with high <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> judgment still take actions (e.g., social activism, protest, grievance, and ... activism, protest, grievance, and milieu change).

NP-completeness is one of the most central concepts in computer science, and has been extensively applied in many diverse application areas. Despite this, students have problems grasping the concept and, more specifically, applying it to new problems. Independently, we have identified these problems at our universities in different countries and ...
