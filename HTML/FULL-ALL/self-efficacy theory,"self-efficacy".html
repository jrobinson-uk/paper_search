<div class="abstract">
The decline in the number of women in computing disciplines has been attributed to different causes, and research on the decline continues to grow. While there are numerous reasons suggested for the imbalance in these disciplines, the perceptions that women hold about their computing capabilities continue to be of interest. ...

Bandura [3, 2] summarizes several focal factors of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> that are relevant for understanding our results.

Implications for expanding <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> research are discussed at the end.

Introduction <em>Self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em>, , or the belief in one’s ability to perform a ... discipline first discussed the need to conceptualize a separate computer <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> (CSE) construct in the late 1980s (Davis, Bagozzi, &amp; Warshaw, ... these discussions and research results, two dominant forms of computer <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> have emerged in information systems research: general computer <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> (CSE) and specific computer <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> (SSE). The key difference between the two <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacies</em> relates to the specificity of the technology that the respondents ... This stream of research highlights the fact that specific computer <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> is a stronger predictor of outcomes (Marakas et al., 1998), ... <br /> ... including the concept of the “task” in measuring the computer <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> construct.

Overall, the literature on <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> states that <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> judgements differ on three distinct, but interrelated, dimensions: psychological confidence/motivation, ...

Generalizability of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> indicates the extent to which perceptions of <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> are limited to particular situations.

The contention is that using computers is a specialized ... software to another (e.g., perceiving a higher level of Excel <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> does not necessarily mean a high level of ERP <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em>. ... .)

Specific <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em>, , a construct argued to reflect skill perception, is statistically ... (Yi &amp; Davis, 2003). Finally, as the theory has suggested, <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> is a measure of both psychological confidence and skill. However, ... the construct (Claggett &amp; Goodhue, 2011), i.e., the general computer <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> construct primarily reflects/measures psychological confidence, while specific <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> primarily reflects/measures skill.

In subsequent sections, we demonstrate the lack of mid-range computer <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> constructs in the literature (Claggett &amp; Goodhue, 2011), a <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> measure where the proportion of psychological confidence and skill perception ... conceptualizing tasks is highlighted by what the respondents to the <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> scales are asked to judge.

This research identifies two intermediate computer <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacies</em>, , i.e., general computer simple task <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> (GS-SE) and specific application complex task <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacy</em> (SC-SE). It also identifies where each of the <em>self</em>- -<em>efficacies</em> is on the task technology continuum (see Figure 2). Some ... (see Figure 2).
