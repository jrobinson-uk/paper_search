Thus we described the following “structural” <em>scaffold</em> characteristics: • Visibility of the <em>scaffold</em> in its workspace. • Essentialness of a scaffold’s use in ... terms of doing the target work. • Coupling of a <em>scaffold</em> with other <em>scaffolds</em> in a given workspace. • Usability of a <em>scaffold</em>. . • Representation of a <em>scaffold</em> in terms of its graphical or textual nature. By correlating ... of its graphical or textual nature. By correlating these structural <em>scaffold</em> characteristics with the “effects with” evaluation information detailing how students ... evaluation information detailing how students did their work with the <em>scaffolds</em>, , we began to distill the following structural <em>scaffolding</em> guidelines (summarized in table 2). Guideline 1: <em>Scaffold</em> Visibility Visibility describes how visible a <em>scaffold</em> in its software workspace: • Visible: The <em>scaffold</em> is always visible in its software workspace. For example, the ...

Representation Neither textual nor graphical <em>scaffolds</em> are inherently better or worse.

Although students need such information (e.g., ... the teachers for this information instead of triggering the appropriate <em>scaffolds</em> ... (e.g., guides).

Guideline 2: <em>Scaffold</em> <br /> use a <em>scaffold</em> to do their work tasks: • Essential: <em>Scaffold</em> use is mandatory for learners to perform a work task. ... proceeding with their work. • Semi-essential: Learners can use a <em>scaffold</em> ... to do a given work task, but there are other <em>scaffolds</em> that can be used to perform the same tasks. • ... tasks. • Optional: Learners can choose to use a lone <em>scaffold</em> to perform a given work task, but it is not ...

For example, the process wheel and plan/log grid directly ... from the wheel to the grid. • Loosely coupled: The <em>scaffold</em> appears with other <em>scaffolds</em> on a given workspace, but the <em>scaffolds</em> are not connected in any manner. For example, the “Visualize ... “Visualize Data” workspace (right side of figure 1) has three <em>scaffolds</em>: : prompted text fields for students to enter information, artifact ... a “flow map” that students use to build graphs.

Since <em>scaffolds</em> must be used together, or since action on a <em>scaffold</em> results in a visible effect on another <em>scaffold</em>, , the learner is implicitly drawn to all the <em>scaffolds</em>. .

Guideline 5: <em>Scaffold</em> Representation Representation simply describes the visual nature of a <em>scaffold</em>: : • Graphical: The <em>scaffold</em> is primarily graphical in nature, using representations such as maps, ... grids, etc. For example, the process map is a graphical <em>scaffold</em>. . • Textual: The <em>scaffold</em> is primarily textual in nature.
