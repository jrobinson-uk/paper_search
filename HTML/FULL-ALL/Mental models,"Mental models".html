Liu and Stasko [16] proposed to use the theory of <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> as a foundation for explaining interaction with InfoVis systems. This ... Stasko’s publication did not result in many empirical studies on <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> in InfoVis. This might be due to the fact that ... did not present detailed methodological guidance for the assessment of <em>mental</em> <em>models</em>. . This paper aims to close this gap. After a ... this gap. After a short introduction to the theory of <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> and their role in InfoVis, we present different methodological approaches ... role in InfoVis, we present different methodological approaches to assess <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> and discuss their relevance for evaluation in InfoVis. 2. <em>MENTAL</em> <em>MODELS</em> When interacting with externally presented information, users continuously build up ... information, users continuously build up an internal representation – a <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> – and use this <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> to interpret the information and to explore it in a ... information and to explore it in a meaningful way. A “<em>mental</em> <em>model</em> is generally defined as an internal representation of an external ... reality, such as a situation, system, or a device” [37]. <em>Mental</em> <em>models</em>, , as originally described by Craik in 1943 [4] and ... ([14], p. 46). The theory of distributed cognition emphasizes that <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> are constructed in the interplay of cognitive systems with their ... tasks that could not be performed without [17]. As such, <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> not only develop through users’ interaction with external representations, but ... representations, but also build on them and include them. 2.1 <em>Mental</em> <em>Models</em> of Information Visualizations Visual displays are effectively used to convey ... <br /> ... of an external representation (on display) – that is, a <em>mental</em> <em>model</em>. . To do so, also prior knowledge is applied – ... applied – especially graph schemata [25] and domain knowledge [5]. <em>Mental</em> <em>models</em> of InfoVis systems consequently contain spatial, chromatic and textual representations ... and structure [16]. For the purpose of problem solving, the <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> is inspected, manipulated and simulated in working memory. In the ... InfoVis system corresponds to the construction and manipulation of a <em>mental</em> <em>model</em>. . A <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> can be complemented by an interactive visualization tool, that acts ... the interaction with InfoVis systems users build up a single <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> or construct different ones for the tool and the data ... and cognitively interconnected. Liu and Stasko [16] assumed that a <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> does preserve tool knowledge and high-level (schematic and semantic) information ... level information. Similarly, we assume that users build up a <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> of the InfoVis tool (“tool <em>mental</em> <em>model</em>” ”), which also includes knowledge about the kind of data ... this system. But in addition, users build up a “data <em>mental</em> <em>model</em>” ”, which includes their knowledge of the data set, relevant ... a tool for problem solving, users have to build up <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> of the problem and relevant data items (“problem space”). When ... work on a task, they use all three kinds of <em>mental</em> <em>models</em>; ; their knowledge about the tool helps them in gaining ...

Consequently, by evaluating the construction and manipulation of <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> we can draw conclusions on how well an InfoVis system ... makes up a mental model’s quality. 2.2 Evaluation Criteria for <em>Mental</em> <em>Models</em> <em>Mental</em> <em>models</em> have different attributes which can be used to describe their ... attributes, which in our opinion are relevant criteria for evaluating <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> in InfoVis. Content. A first relevant attribute of a <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> is the content of the data or information stored within ... it. Norman [22] not only points out the incompleteness of <em>mental</em> <em>models</em>, , but also observed that <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> <br /> ... make no sense” (p. 8f.). Consequently, a thorough examination of <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> should aim at answering the following questions: What information from ... which data was left out (Completeness)? How exhaustive is the <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> for the system at hand? Is the <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> a correct internal representation of the external system or did ... Especially for multidimensional data, what dimensions are included in the <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> and are they related (Dimensionality)? A <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> builds on earlier <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> and includes prior knowledge. Especially expert users link their understanding ... representation [12]. The question arises, how the information within a <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> is structured and organized, but also how data and the ... structured and organized, but also how data and the tool <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> are interconnected. As misconceptions in the understanding of the InfoVis ... the InfoVis system likely lead to misconceptions in the data <em>mental</em> <em>model</em>, , the interconnectivity of the data and tool <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> is especially relevant. Coherence. Research on text comprehension and narration ... the role of coherence in (or between the parts of) <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> [19]. A coherent <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> requires that the information pieces within are consistent and well ... pieces within are consistent and well interconnected. Building a coherent <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> is an incremental process that can be supported by specific ... fragmentary representations - so-called cognitive collages [35]. In contrast, coherent <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> are accurate, analogous representations independent of perspective that “capture the ... complex environments. Perspectivity. Tversky [35] emphasized that a fully coherent <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> allows perspective-taking and mentally looking at the information from different ... information from different viewpoints. Spence [30] illustrates perspectivity with the <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> of an underground system: Will you find your way within ... to be relevant, which perspectives are included in the user's <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> and which are left out?

This later definition directly relates to <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> as constructed structures of knowledge; in this sense, users gain ... pieces. Such inferences are important processes in the construction of <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> [11]. In 2008, we suggested to relate insights into the ... The resulting graph shows how the involved tool and data <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> build on one another and are related. But think-aloud protocols ... only reveal insights. To understand users’ initial construction of tool <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> we usually let them freely explore an InfoVis tool and ... procedure, we are able to analyze the construction of tool <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> in the think-aloud protocols. This knowledge is especially valuable in ... and to redesign the InfoVis system accordingly. 3.2.3 Problem Solving <em>Mental</em> <em>models</em> are linked to the quality of problem solutions [21]. In ... plays a central role, since the tasks will influence which <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> will be generated by the user (if the user solves ... user solves the task). For example, if dimensionality of the <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> is of interest, tasks have to be developed which require ... be assumed that he integrated these data dimensions in his <em>mental</em> <em>model</em>, , too. Or if perspectivity is of interest, tasks should ... solutions often resulted, when study participants generated only a fragmentary <em>mental</em> <em>model</em> and did not integrate all information available. We could also ... information available. We could also observe how users generalize their <em>mental</em> <em>models</em> and transfer their understanding from one InfoVis system to a ... to a similar one. 4.
