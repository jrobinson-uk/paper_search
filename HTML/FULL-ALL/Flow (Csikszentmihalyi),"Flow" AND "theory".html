In the same network, theflow rates ... real networks. In the same network, theflow rates of one-way <em>flows</em> and those of two-way <em>flows</em> arepossibly not the same. In this section, the <em>flow</em> rates in thefollowing two scenarios will be compared. In Scenario ...

The other style of <em>flow</em> map is the <em>flow</em> tree [11, 12, 14-16, 24]. In this case, the <em>flow</em> lines are rarely straight and consist of winding or spiral ... spiral link lines. The maps that have straight or arc-shaped <em>flow</em> lines have methodological origins in Tobler’s <em>flow</em> ... maps [2]. Tobler developed a software program to automatically draw <em>flow</em> lines on a digital map.

<strong>Abstract</strong>:<br />
&lt;p&gt;We present a novel <em>flow</em> mapping method called Animated <em>Flow</em> Mapper. Conventional <em>flow</em> mapping uses the thickness of a <em>flow</em> line to differentiate the volume of a <em>flow</em> and arrows to represent the direction. These <em>flow</em> mapping methods have suffered from problems of occlusion especially for ... especially for visualizing large volumes of data, and when many <em>flows</em> converge at--or diverge from--single points. The Animated <em>Flow</em> Mapper aims to circumvent these problems of occlusion and to ... provide a more effective visualization of the patterns of the <em>flows</em>. . The method uses thin dashed lines of equal width, ... which are animated to represent the directions and volumes of <em>flows</em> of moving objects by repeatedly redrawing each dashed-line at different ... human subject opinion survey show the advantages of the Animated <em>Flow</em> Mapper are comparable to other <em>flow</em> <br />
